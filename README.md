# ops201d10-challenges


### What is this repo all about?
Welcome!

This repo is a collection of Ops201 coding assignments centered around learning the fundamentals of Python, Bash, and PowerShell. 
### Why are you learning these skills?
To automate and read scripts while working and to protect assets.
### What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
I am learning these skills to increase my overall efficiency when completing cybersecurity tasks in the terminal. These exercises taught me how to use functions, variables, loops, arguments, and conditionals.
### What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
Challenge 5 Loops was my favorite. It was a simple bash loop script that was easy to read, but each line was unique and something new I learned in class.
### How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
- In the workplace, the shell scripting skills I gained from Challenge 5 Loops can be incredibly valuable in automating repetitive tasks and improving efficiency. For example, I can create scripts to automate file backups, perform system maintenance tasks, or manage large datasets. Writing concise and effective shell scripts saves time and reduces the risk of human error in the manual execution of these tasks.
- Additionally, the script's readability is crucial in a professional setting where collaboration and maintenance are key. Colleagues can easily understand and modify the scripts, ensuring the automation processes remain effective and adaptable to changing requirements.
### What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
I would continue improving my Bash and PowerShell scripting. 
### What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
I want to strengthen shell scripting automation on my personal and lab computers.
